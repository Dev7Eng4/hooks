# JSX

- It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.
- It makes it easier for us to create templates.
- Instead of separating the markup and logic in separated files, React uses components for this purpose. We will learn about components in detail in further articles.

# KEY

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
Thus, using the key attribute helps to avoid unnecessary re-renderings in the application.
